In a daring display of technological fusion, a nuclear-powered train, fueled by meteorite crystal fragments dubbed "StellarFuel", embarked on a journey shrouded in mystery. Departing from a bustling station amidst both anticipation and trepidation, the train embarked on an expedition promising to push the boundaries of transportation and exploration. Laden with essential cargo, including <color=purple><link=guncart>a gun cart (1)</link></color>, <color=purple><link=ammocart>an ammo cart (2)</link></color>, and <color=purple><link=repaircart>a repair cart (10)</link></color>, the train's exact composition remained a subject of speculation, with some sources suggesting <color=purple>a total of up to 4 carts (10)</color>, yet the truth eluded certainty.

Unfortunately <color=purple><link=gatlingtech>gatling (1)</link></color> and <color=purple><link=shieldtech>shield (2)</link></color> technology wasn't ready at the time of the train's departure. Research on <color=purple><link=growthtech>growth (3)</link></color> and <color=purple><link=uraniumtech>uranium (5)</link></color> crystals is also still in progress.

However, the train's departure marked the beginning of a saga that would leave observers haunted by unanswered questions. Despite the initial fanfare, the train's journey was marred by uncertainty and unease. Weeks turned into months, and still, the nuclear locomotive <color=purple><link=unlockboss>failed to return back to our city (20)</link></color>. As speculation gave way to concern and eventually to despair, the fate of the enigmatic train became a somber reminder of the risks inherent in pushing the boundaries of scientific exploration.

What will the fate of our city without the supplies promised by the train? We must endure...
