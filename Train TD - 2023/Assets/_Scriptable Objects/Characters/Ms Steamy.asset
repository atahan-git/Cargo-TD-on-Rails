    uniqueName: Asha Desai
    description: Mostly unaffected by the loss of technology, Asha was a steam train
      enthusiast before <color=#AE2FBA>The Cataclysm</color>. Before, they called
      her eccentric, but with people back to steam age her value grew. As she liked
      the attention, she found it irresistible when <color=#f694ff>The Collective</color>
      asked her to carry out an important mission.
